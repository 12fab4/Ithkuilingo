The formative

A **formative** is a type of word that can act as both a noun and a verb, depending on how it's used in a sentence. Unlike English, where nouns and verbs are separate parts of speech (like "dog" as a noun and "run" as a verb), a formative in New Ithkuil can represent both an object or entity and an action or state at the same time. For instance, in New Ithkuil, a single formative based on the concept of naming could mean "a name" when used like a noun, or "to name" when used like a verb.

Think of a formative as a flexible word that can be shaped by its context to mean different things. The choice between using it as a noun or a verb isn't fixed in the word itself but is determined by how it fits into the rest of the sentence and its grammatical markers.

This flexibility is based on the idea that nouns and verbs are not fundamentally different but rather two aspects of the same thing, much like how space and time are part of the same continuum in physics. So, in Ithkuil, when you use a formative, you're choosing to focus on either its *spatial* aspect (making it more noun-like) or its *temporal* aspect (making it more verb-like), depending on what you want to express.

Each formative is composed of several slots, where each slot contains a specific component that conveys a specific information. Some of these slots are required (i.e. they have to be filled in order to form a grammatically correct formative), others are optional and can be used to further add nuance. You will gradually learn about how to fill these slots in the following tutorials.
