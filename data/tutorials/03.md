Roots and stems

The **root** in New Ithkuil acts like the core or the base of a word. It consists of one or more consonants and holds the basic meaning of the word, but it doesn't function as a word on its own. Think of it as the underlying theme or idea. For example, the root -DN- carries the basic idea of naming or designation.

**Stems** are derived from roots and are what turn these abstract ideas into usable words. Each root can generate multiple stems, each representing a slightly different aspect or application of the root's basic meaning.

Typically, each root produces three main stems. Each of those stems is specified by adding a specific vowel (vocalic affix) to the root and represents a slightly different meaning:

- First Stem (a-): Takes the basic meaning of the root and gives it a direct, straightforward meaning
- Second Stem (e-): Shifts the focus slightly, often specifying or altering the base idea
- Third Stem (u-): Further adjusts or specifies the base idea

For example, the root -VL- (realization / understanding / comprehension) has three stems with the following meanings:

- "realization through insight / intuition"
- "understanding / comprehending sth through analysis or discussion"
- "understanding / comprehending sth through new material"

Additionally, thereâ€™s a concept of "Stem Zero," indicated by the vowel -o-. This form is more generalized and doesn't specify the way the root's idea is used; it amalgamates all potential uses into one.
