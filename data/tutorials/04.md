Specifications

**Specifications** are used to further refine and clarify the meaning of a word. A Specification functions like an additional layer of detail that tells you more about how a stem should be understood within a sentence. This helps in precisely communicating the intended idea.

Each stem, including the generalized "Stem Zero," can be modified by one of four Specifications:

1. **Basic** (BSC): Used to express the stem in its most *general* and straightforward sense without adding any particular nuance. It encompasses the meanings of the CTE and CSV specifications.
2. **Contential** (CTE): Used to express a more *contextual* interpretation of the stem, emphasizing how the concept is embedded or integrated into its surroundings.
3. **Constitutive** (CSV): Here, the focus is on the *internal makeup or constitution* of the concept being discussed. It’s about what the concept fundamentally consists of or is made up of.
4. **Objective** (OBJ): Deals with the *external aspects or objectives* related to the concept. It focuses on the outcomes, purposes, or goals associated with the stem.

Choosing a Specification allows you to pinpoint exactly what aspect of the word you want to highlight. As an example, this is how using each Specification might convey a different meaning when using a stem derived from the root for "list"

1. BSC: making a list; being arranged on a list
2. CTE: the order of items on a list
3. CSV: the act / process of making a list
4. OBJ: an entity named on a list

Specifications are expressed by adding a vocalic affix after the stem (in Slot IV of the formative):

1. -a- for Basic (BSC)
2. -ä- for Contential (CTE)
3. -e- for Constitutive (CSV)
4. -i- for Objective (OBJ)

For instance, when using the 2nd stem of the root -LK- (music / play music / compose music), the forms of the four specifications would be "elka", "elkä", "elke" and "elki".
